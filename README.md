## Description
Sketchfab - [Game ready](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/palestines-scorched-spear-game-ready-038aa335c9ef406baa1016e1da5f525d) | [Showcase](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/palestines-scorched-spear-showcase-43e45d5a328a40a984497def99a1d59c)

This weapon symbolizes resistance. The charred state represents past struggles, while the embers signify an enduring spirit. The tattered flag, still alight, embodies unwavering resilience. I like to use a fantasy flair so the concept for the design was 'A weapon used to battle an ifrit.' All the elements of the design come from this in one way or another.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get the .uassets migrated into your project.

### Prerequisites

There are no requirements for the model, but for the unreal project you will need:
- [Unreal Engine (version 5.3 or later)](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)
- A compatible system that meets Unreal Engine's hardware and software requirements


### Installing

This guide assumes you have Unreal Engine (version 5.3 or later) installed.

1. Open the Source Project: Open the PalestineSpear project that contains the model.
2. Locate the Asset: In the Content Browser within the source project, navigate to **Content** > **PalestineScorchedSpear** > **Meshes** to find the `ScorchedRumh_SK` asset.
3. Prepare for Migration: Right-click on the `ScorchedRumh_SK` asset and select ‘Asset Actions’ > ‘Migrate’. This will open a dialogue box showing all the assets that will be migrated along with `ScorchedRumh_SK`. Confirm that all necessary assets are included.
4. Select Destination: After confirming the assets to migrate, you’ll be prompted to choose the destination folder. Navigate to the ‘Content’ folder of the project you want to import the model into.
5. Complete the Migration: Select the destination ‘Content’ folder and proceed with the migration. Unreal Engine will copy all the selected assets to the destination project.
6. Verify the Migration: Open the destination project and verify that `ScorchedRumh_SK` and the associated assets have been successfully migrated and are functioning as expected.

Remember to save any changes in both the source and destination projects to ensure the migration is properly recorded. If you encounter any issues, check the Unreal Engine documentation or community forums for troubleshooting tips.
