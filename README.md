This weapon symbolizes resistance. The charred state represents past struggles, while the embers signify an enduring spirit. The tattered flag, still alight, embodies unwavering resilience. I like to use a fantasy flair so the concept for the design was 'A weapon used to battle an ifrit.' All the elements of the design come from this in one way or another.

### Scorched tip.
![Scorched tip](https://github.com/rowanhopkins98/PalestineSpear-3dModel/blob/main/Images/TipClean.png?raw=true)
The metal and wood being scorched and charred was a pretty obvious design choice to me with the concept of battling an ifrit. At first I was going to leave it as just charcoal but after playing around with an emissive texture in the cracks of the charcoal I decided to keep it and from there added it where the metal meets the shaft to emulate burning. 

### Limiter ring & Dua.
![Limiter ring & Dua](https://github.com/rowanhopkins98/PalestineSpear-3dModel/blob/main/Images/CleanDua.png?raw=true)
The ring is inspired by wings on boar spears. The use of these was to stop the boar from running up the spear and this ring would serve the same function. It has a dua inscribed on it for protection. 

### Hamsa amulet & Key of return.
![Hama amulet & key of return](https://github.com/rowanhopkins98/PalestineSpear-3dModel/blob/main/Images/Charms.png?raw=true)
I knew from the start I wanted to have a key hanging off it somewhere, then in my research I came across [this thread.](http://www.vikingsword.com/vb/showthread.php?p=235114) One of the posters said “E A Wallis Budge in his book “Amulets and Superstitions” 1930, makes mention of the amulet being attached to weapons (including spears) to confer power and strength to both the weapon and user.” So I decided to add that too. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get the .uassets migrated into your project.

### Prerequisites

There are no requirements for the model, but for the unreal project you will need:
- [Unreal Engine (version 5.3 or later)](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)
- A compatible system that meets Unreal Engine's hardware and software requirements


### Installing

This guide assumes you have Unreal Engine (version 5.3 or later) installed.

1. Open the Source Project: Open the PalestineSpear project that contains the model.
2. Locate the Asset: In the Content Browser within the source project, navigate to **Content** > **PalestineScorchedSpear** > **Meshes** to find the `ScorchedRumh_SK` asset.
3. Prepare for Migration: Right-click on the `ScorchedRumh_SK` asset and select ‘Asset Actions’ > ‘Migrate’. This will open a dialogue box showing all the assets that will be migrated along with `ScorchedRumh_SK`. Confirm that all necessary assets are included.
4. Select Destination: After confirming the assets to migrate, you’ll be prompted to choose the destination folder. Navigate to the ‘Content’ folder of the project you want to import the model into.
5. Complete the Migration: Select the destination ‘Content’ folder and proceed with the migration. Unreal Engine will copy all the selected assets to the destination project.
6. Verify the Migration: Open the destination project and verify that `ScorchedRumh_SK` and the associated assets have been successfully migrated and are functioning as expected.

Remember to save any changes in both the source and destination projects to ensure the migration is properly recorded. If you encounter any issues, check the Unreal Engine documentation or community forums for troubleshooting tips.
