# Palestine's Scorched Spear - 3D model.

This 3D model features a charred spear with the tattered remains of the Palestinian flag still faintly glowing at the edges. It's a symbolic weapon designed to show solidarity with the Palestinian people.

### Features

- **High-Resolution Textures**: Available in 4k, 2k, and 1k.
- **Emissive Textures**: Two intensity levels for dynamic visual effects.
- **Materials**: Clean and blood-stained versions for diverse scenarios.
- **Baked Mesh Maps**: Detailed and optimized for performance.
- **Unreal Engine 5 Project**: Fully set up for easy migration to your projects.
- **Parameterized Material Instances**: Allows for extensive customization.
- **Configured Physics Asset**: Realistic interactions within the environment.
- **Cloth Simulation**: Dynamic movement for the flag.
- **Physics Simulation**: Key and Hamsa amulet dynamically move with the spear.

## Description & Showcase

The spear is designed with a historical narrative, having been wielded in ancient times to combat an ifrit. Its embering edges and battle-worn flag tell a story of resilience and strength.

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

There are no requirements for the model, but for the unreal project you will need:
- [Unreal Engine (version 5.3 or later)](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)
- A compatible system that meets Unreal Engine's hardware and software requirements


### Installing

environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo
